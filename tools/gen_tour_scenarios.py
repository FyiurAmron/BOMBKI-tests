"""Generate navigation-tour scenarios from the reconstructed sources.

The room graph, each room's identifying intro line, and each
room's movement commands are all derived from the reconstructed
units, so a tour cannot drift from the code. Waypoints are
listed explicitly and the legs between them are shortest paths,
which keeps every generated walk legal: the room graph has dead
ends (the cage corridor at 11 is only escapable through 17 to the
teleport room 18), so a naive depth-first tour would emit moves
the player cannot make.
